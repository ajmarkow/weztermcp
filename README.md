# WezTerm MCP Server

## Overview

This is a MCP server for WezTerm.
It allows you to control WezTerm from Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

## Tools

| Tool | Required Args | Optional Args | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wezterm_pane_write` | `command: string`, `pane_id: number` | — | Writes text or runs a command in the specified pane |
| `wezterm_pane_read` | `pane_id: number` | `lines: number` (default 50) | Reads output from a pane's scrollback buffer |
| `wezterm_pane_send_key` | `character: string`, `pane_id: number` | — | Sends a control character to the specified pane (e.g. `"c"` for Ctrl+C) |
| `wezterm_pane_list` | — | `window_id: number`, `tab_id: number` | Lists panes, scoped to the active window/tab by default |
| `wezterm_pane_switch` | `pane_id: number` | — | Switches focus to the specified pane |
| `wezterm_pane_close` | `pane_id: number` | — | Closes the specified pane |
| `wezterm_pane_split` | `direction: "Right"\|"Left"\|"Top"\|"Bottom"` | `pane_id: number`, `window_id: number`, `tab_id: number` | Splits a pane and returns the new pane ID |
| `wezterm_pane_split_and_write` | `command: string`, `direction: "Right"\|"Left"\|"Top"\|"Bottom"` | `pane_id: number`, `window_id: number`, `tab_id: number` | Splits a pane and writes a command to the new pane in one call |
| `wezterm_window_spawn` | — | `cwd: string` | Opens a new top-level WezTerm window and returns its initial pane ID |

## Multi-window and multi-tab support

`pane_id` is globally unique across all of WezTerm's windows and tabs, so most tools (`wezterm_pane_write`, `wezterm_pane_read`, `wezterm_pane_send_key`, `wezterm_pane_switch`, `wezterm_pane_close`) don't need window/tab scoping — they just target the pane directly.

`wezterm_pane_list`, `wezterm_pane_split`, and `wezterm_pane_split_and_write` are the exceptions, since they need to know *which* window/tab to operate on when a specific pane isn't given:
- `wezterm_pane_list` defaults to listing only the panes in the currently focused window and tab. Pass `window_id` and/or `tab_id` to list panes elsewhere.
- `wezterm_pane_split` and `wezterm_pane_split_and_write` default to splitting the currently focused pane. If `pane_id` is omitted, pass `window_id`/`tab_id` to split the focused pane within that window/tab instead.

## Common workflow: split and run

The most common real-world pattern — open a side pane and run something in it while keeping the original pane visible — is `wezterm_pane_split_and_write`, a single call combining split + write:

> Split the focused pane Right and run `npm test`.

This is equivalent to calling `wezterm_pane_split` followed by `wezterm_pane_write` on the returned pane ID, but atomic and requires only one tool call. Since it doesn't return command output, follow up with `wezterm_pane_read` on the new pane ID to see results.

## Security

This server gives an MCP client the ability to run arbitrary shell commands in any open WezTerm pane, with the full permissions of the user running WezTerm. There is no sandboxing, allowlisting, or command filtering — `wezterm_pane_write` will execute anything sent to it, including destructive operations like `rm -rf`, force pushes, or database migrations.

**Risk model:**
- Any agent connected to this server can read, write, and close panes it did not open, including ones with unrelated work in progress.
- `wezterm_pane_write` and `wezterm_pane_close` are flagged in their tool descriptions as requiring user confirmation before destructive or irreversible actions, but this is advisory only — the server itself does not block or intercept any command.
- Only connect this server to trusted MCP clients, and review agent-issued commands before they run if your client supports that.

## Installation

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weztermcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "weztermcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Releasing

Publishing to npm is automated via `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. On every push to `main`, CI runs the test suite and build, then publishes to npm if `package.json`'s `version` field isn't already published — no publish happens if the version is unchanged.

To cut a release:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (e.g. `npm version patch`, `npm version minor`, or edit directly).
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. CI runs tests, builds, and publishes automatically if the tests pass and the version is new.

Publishing uses [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) via OIDC — no npm token or repository secret is needed. The `weztermcp` package on npmjs.com must have this repo's `publish.yml` workflow configured as a trusted publisher (Package Settings → Trusted Publisher on npmjs.com), and the workflow's `publish` job grants itself `id-token: write` to mint the short-lived OIDC credential at publish time.
